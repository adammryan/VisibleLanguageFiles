            <h2>Book of Mormon Word Cloud Help Page</h2>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
           <p>Click on one of the three Chart Type buttons at the bottom of the page to begin.</p>
           <p>The three chart types are as follows: <br><br>
            - Content Words: Words such as nouns and verbs that describe what is happening or what is involved in a sentence.<br>
            - Function Words: Words such as articles and prepositions that help build the mechanical structure of a sentence.<br>
            - Theme Words: A chart consisting of both content and function words that are sorted by the thematic nature of the in-text context</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Selecting a new speaker</h3>
            <p>
                If you want to see the word choice of a different speaker, choose a speaker from the drop-down menu. The drop-down menu is located 
                above the top right corner of the bubbles display window, or above the yellow chart type buttons (mobile).
            </p>
            <h3>Filter Controls</h3>
            <p><strong>Range</strong> 
                <br> <br>
                If you have Priority/Rank selected, it will display words based on which are most common. The first word would be the word used most 
                by the speaker (words like “the” or “a”). You can select the top 10 words by setting the range 0 to 10, or the top 20 words by setting 
                the range 0 to 20. The range does not have to start at 0; you can display the 43rd most common word up through the 51st most common 
                word by setting the range 43 to 51. If you select a number above the amount of words a speaker has, the upper limit will default to 
                the least used words.
                <br><br>
                If you have Frequency selected, it will display words based on how many times they are used. If you want to 
                see words that are used more than 10 times, set the range 10 to the maximum number. To display words that are used between 3 and 8 
                times, set the range 3 to 8, and so on. This can help filter out words that are not used often, or words that are used a lot that 
                are not helpful to your search.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Part of Speech</strong> 
                <br><br>
                If you have the content or function word display up, you can filter which words appear based on parts of speech. In the filter box, 
                the colored boxes show which parts of speech will be displayed (noun, adjective, verb, etc.) and can be toggled on and off. The chart 
                will automatically update as you adjust the filter, and you can select any combinations of parts of speech to display.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Theme</strong> 
                <br><br>
                Similar to parts of speech, if you have the Words by Theme display selected, you can filter which words appear based on their theme. 
                The colored boxes in the filter show which themes are displayed and can be toggled on and off.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Unique Words</strong> 
                <br><br>
                Toggle the unique words button on and off to display words that only the selected speaker uses.
            </p>
            <h3>Word Cloud Interaction</h3>
            <p>While viewing a graph, the user has a few options for interacting with the graph. The larger bubbles will display a words’ frequency; 
                for the smaller words, hover over the bubble to see its word count. If a bubble is clicked, the graph will "zoom-in" on the selected 
                word, revealing more information such as a quote from the speaker where the word is used. This mode can be exited by clicking the 
                bubble again.
