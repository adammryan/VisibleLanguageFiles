Displaying timeline as a 3-D ring. Also shows connections diagram. Stopped development on this display to focus on preparing for FAIR Conference 2021.
Also, 3-D Graphic is interesting but doesn't really convey a linear timeline. The code for the 3-D graphic might be helpful for building other 3-D graphics.
This connections diagram has all 80+ speakers. Other current timelines just have the main 20ish speakers.
