This project was aimed at bringing the timeline graphic and connections graphic into one place.
We decided that it would make more sense to keep those graphics separate. Although it was cool to animate from one to another, the information will be better conveyed if the graphics are done separately.
The interface of having speakers pop up and able to be moved around might be useful for a future project.
This was in development Sept 2021 but we stopped after we decided to keep graphics separate.
